**This repository contains the FreeCAD project, stl and some example gcodes for all the 3D printed components for this project.**

The FreeCAD project file contains an older version of the PCB, but that doesn’t matter since the placement of all major components are not changed. For assembly, you will also need:

- 4 M1.7×16 screws

- 4 M1.7×8 screws

- 1 M1.7×5 screws

- 6 M1.7×5 screws with shim

I built two versions using clear PETG and carbon fiber nylon (Polymaker PA612-CF). My 3D printer requires different tolerances for these two materials, so I have to slightly adjust the models in CAD. Both versions are provided. The 'base' version under [/stl](stl) are for PETG, four parts need adjustment for PA-CF, those are under [/stl/PA](stl/PA).

In [/stl/common](stl/common) are components shared by both versions. The button and the display standoff (which you need 4) need to be printed in TPU. While the detector case should be printed in black, opaque filament. I used black ASA for these. Note that you need to trim away a corner of the detector-bottom for it to fit properly, as shown below.

I used clear PETG because I wanted to make a transparent version to showcase the internal. Which obviously didn't work particularly well. But it still looks pretty cool.

Functionally this is also not a good idea, as i discovered. The transparent shell allowed some light to leak into the detector assembly. But several strips of electrical tape fixed that. 

There are four LEDs in total, a power indicator and a programmable RGB LED on the pro micro facing to the rear, a pulse indicator and another programmable LED on the front. There's a hole above each LED, you can leave it as is. However, the size of the hole is such that you can use a short piece of clear 3D printing filament as light guide. Which is what I did, as shown below.

In [/gcode](gcode) are some example gcodes for prusa mini. When printing the bottom shell, there're some cooling issues in this overhang area, as highlighted below.

This should not be a problem if you are using the usual settings. However, I'm trying to make it transparent. Meaning I have to print at low speed, with no fan and 100% infill. This deposits a lot of heat in this small area, causing it to warp. So I used the modifier function to add some infill in this area. It helped, but it still warped.

The solution would be to turn on cooling fan. But I don't want the fan to be on constantly, that will cloud up my parts. In prusa slicer, fan settings are under filament properties. The modifier function cannot adjust these settings, there's no way to turn on cooling fan only in the area needed. So I quickly put together a python script to turn on cooling fan once the print head moves inside a specified bounding box. This script is also provided. If you are using binary gcode, you need to set output format to ASCII gcode first.

Note that I'm using prusa slicer, it may not work for gcode generated by other slicers.
